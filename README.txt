If your computer does not have a webcam and you need a screen recorder, then this is your app! 
This app lets you record your screen along with the audio from your system and even the sounds from the real 
world (such as your voice) that your computer's microphone hears. In other words, this app allows you to make
videos (mp4 files) that are akin to YouTube videos where a person's computer screen is recorded along with the
sounds from their computer, but you can also hear the person speaking as well. If you are trying to become a YouTuber,
then you can actually do so with this app and you don't have to spend a lot of money on a fancy webcam.
